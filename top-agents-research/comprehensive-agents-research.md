## Deployment Strategies & Best Practices

### Starter Configuration (5-8 Agents)
**Philosophy**: Start lean, scale based on workflow complexity

**Essential Set**:
1. `code-reviewer` - Quality gate
2. `security-auditor` - Security compliance
3. `performance-optimizer` - Performance checks
4. `test-suite-generator` - Testing automation
5. Language specialist (Python/TypeScript/JavaScript)

**Optional Additions**:
- Frontend or backend specialist (based on stack)
- CLI utilities for common tasks

**Expected Outcome**: 40% productivity gain; optimal over comprehensive deployment

---

### Full Automation (20-35 Agents)
**Philosophy**: Complete SDLC coverage with orchestration

**Coverage Areas**:
- Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment
- Parallel processing (up to 10 agents simultaneously)
- Multi-agent orchestration patterns

**Orchestration Example**:
```
requirements-analyst → system-architect → [
  frontend-developer (parallel)
  backend-developer (parallel)
] → code-reviewer → test-suite-generator → deployment-engineer
```

**Expected Outcome**: 10x efficiency in complex projects; end-to-end automation

---

### Critical Success Factors

**What Works**:
- **Context isolation** - Prevents "context pollution" in long conversations
- **Single responsibility** - One agent, one clear purpose
- **Parallel processing** - Multiple agents = faster delivery
- **Intelligent delegation** - Auto-delegation based on task context

**What Doesn't Work**:
- Overly general agents (jack-of-all-trades)
- Mixing concerns (frontend + backend in one agent)
- Skipping configuration (no CLAUDE.md file)

---

### Configuration Best Practices

**CLAUDE.md File** (Project-specific configs):
```markdown
# Project Context
- Tech stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL
- Architecture: Microservices with REST APIs
- Deployment: AWS ECS with Docker

# Active Agents
- code-reviewer: Enforce company style guide
- security-auditor: OWASP + PCI compliance
- test-suite-generator: 80% coverage requirement
```

**Extended Thinking Modes**:
- `"think"` - Standard reasoning (8K tokens)
- `"think hard"` - Deep analysis (16K tokens)
- `"think harder"` - Complex problems (24K tokens)
- `"ultrathink"` - Maximum reasoning (32K tokens)

Use for: Architecture decisions, complex refactors, security audits

**Test-Driven Workflows**:
1. `test-suite-generator` creates tests from requirements
2. Developer/agent implements to pass tests
3. `code-reviewer` validates against standards
4. `security-auditor` scans for vulnerabilities
5. `deployment-engineer` handles CI/CD
