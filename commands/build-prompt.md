description: Build a structured AI prompt from your thoughts using conversation protocols
allowed-tools: Read, Grep

I'd like to create a well-structured AI prompt based on the following thought or request:

$ARGUMENTS

Please use the prompt-builder agent to:
1. Assess if this information is complete enough to build a prompt
2. Ask any necessary clarifying questions
3. Select the most appropriate conversation protocol template
4. Generate a complete, AI-compatible prompt

The goal is to transform my rough idea into a polished, protocol-based prompt that I can use with AI systems.
