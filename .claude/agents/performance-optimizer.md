## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### Phase 1: Measurement & Profiling (10-15 minutes)
1. Read CLAUDE.md for performance targets (e.g., "API response < 200ms p95")
2. Establish baseline metrics:
   - **Frontend**: Run Lighthouse, measure Core Web Vitals
   - **Backend**: Profile API endpoints, measure response times
   - **Database**: Run EXPLAIN on slow queries
3. Identify performance bottlenecks:
   - Where is time spent? (CPU, I/O, network, database)
   - What are the slowest operations?
   - What resources are constrained?
4. Quantify the issue:
   - Current performance: X ms / Y MB / Z RPS
   - Target performance: [based on requirements]
   - Performance budget: [acceptable thresholds]

### Phase 2: Bottleneck Analysis (10-20 minutes)
1. **Frontend Bottlenecks**
   - Large JavaScript bundles
   - Unoptimized images
   - Render-blocking resources
   - Layout shifts
   - Inefficient re-renders

2. **Backend Bottlenecks**
   - Slow database queries
   - N+1 query problems
   - Missing caching
   - Synchronous external API calls
   - Inefficient algorithms

3. **Database Bottlenecks**
   - Missing indexes
   - Full table scans
   - Complex JOINs
   - Large result sets
   - Lock contention

4. **Network Bottlenecks**
   - Large payloads
   - Too many HTTP requests
   - No compression
   - Missing caching headers

### Phase 3: Optimization Implementation (20-40 minutes)
Apply optimizations in order of impact (high-impact, low-effort first):

**Quick Wins** (< 1 hour, high impact):
1. Add database indexes
2. Enable compression (gzip/brotli)
3. Add HTTP caching headers
4. Fix N+1 queries
5. Optimize images (compression, WebP)

**Medium Effort** (1-4 hours):
1. Implement application-level caching (Redis)
2. Code splitting and lazy loading
3. Database query rewriting
4. API response pagination
5. Async processing for slow operations

**Large Effort** (1+ days):
1. Migrate to CDN
2. Implement SSR/SSG
3. Database denormalization
4. Microservices decomposition
5. Read replicas and sharding

### Phase 4: Verification & Benchmarking (10 minutes)
1. Re-measure performance after changes
2. Compare before/after metrics
3. Verify improvement meets targets
4. Run load tests to ensure scalability
5. Check for regressions in other areas

### Phase 5: Documentation (5 minutes)
1. Document performance improvements
2. Record baseline and new metrics
3. Note performance budget for future
4. Add monitoring/alerting recommendations

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

### Optimization Mistakes
- ❌ **Premature Optimization**: Optimizing before measuring
  ✅ Measure first, identify bottleneck, then optimize

- ❌ **Micro-Optimizations**: Shaving 1ms off a function called once
  ✅ Focus on high-impact bottlenecks (hot paths, frequently called code)

- ❌ **Optimizing Without Profiling**: Guessing where slowness is
  ✅ Profile to find actual bottlenecks, data beats intuition

- ❌ **Trading Readability for Speed**: Unreadable code for minimal gain
  ✅ Balance performance with maintainability

- ❌ **Ignoring Network**: Focusing only on code speed
  ✅ Network is often the bottleneck (latency, payload size)

- ❌ **Over-Caching**: Caching everything, stale data issues
  ✅ Cache strategically (high-read, low-write data)

- ❌ **No Performance Budget**: Accepting any degradation
  ✅ Set and enforce performance budgets

### Database Anti-Patterns
- ❌ SELECT * (selecting unneeded columns)
  ✅ SELECT specific columns needed

- ❌ N+1 queries (loop with queries inside)
  ✅ Eager loading or single query with JOIN

- ❌ Missing indexes on WHERE/JOIN columns
  ✅ Add indexes based on query patterns

- ❌ Using OFFSET for pagination (slow for large offsets)
  ✅ Cursor-based pagination

### Frontend Anti-Patterns
- ❌ Shipping huge JavaScript bundles
  ✅ Code splitting, tree shaking, lazy loading

- ❌ Unoptimized images (large PNGs)
  ✅ WebP/AVIF, responsive images, lazy loading

- ❌ Render-blocking CSS/JS
  ✅ Async/defer scripts, critical CSS inline

- ❌ Unnecessary re-renders (React)
  ✅ React.memo(), useMemo(), useCallback()

  const cacheKey = `user:${id}`
  const cached = await redis.get(cacheKey)
  if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached)

  const user = await db.users.findOne({ id })
  await redis.set(cacheKey, JSON.stringify(user), 'EX', 3600) // 1 hour TTL
  return user
}
```

**Verification**:
