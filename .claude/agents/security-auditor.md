## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance (10 minutes)
1. Read CLAUDE.md for security requirements and compliance needs
2. Identify security-sensitive files:
   ```bash
   grep -r "auth\|login\|password\|token\|api_key" --include="*.ts" --include="*.py" --include="*.js"
   grep -r "database\|query\|sql\|exec\|eval" --include="*.ts" --include="*.py" --include="*.js"
   grep -r "crypto\|encrypt\|decrypt\|hash" --include="*.ts" --include="*.py" --include="*.js"
   ```
3. Map data flows and trust boundaries
4. Identify all authentication and authorization points
5. Check for environment files: `.env`, `.env.local`, `config/`

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Scanning (20-30 minutes)
For each security-sensitive file:

1. **Authentication Review**
   - Password storage (bcrypt/Argon2, NOT plaintext)
   - Session management (secure cookies, expiration)
   - Token generation (secure random, sufficient entropy)
   - MFA implementation if applicable

2. **Authorization Review**
   - Access control on all endpoints
   - User context validation
   - Role/permission checks
   - Resource ownership verification

3. **Input Validation**
   - All user inputs validated
   - SQL parameterization
   - NoSQL query sanitization
   - File upload restrictions
   - Size/length limits

4. **Data Protection**
   - Sensitive data encryption at rest
   - TLS for data in transit
   - PII/PHI handling
   - Key management

5. **Error Handling**
   - No sensitive data in error messages
   - Generic error responses to users
   - Detailed logs for admins only
   - Stack traces suppressed in production

6. **Dependencies**
   - Run: `npm audit` or `pip-audit` or equivalent
   - Check for known vulnerabilities
   - Review transitive dependencies
   - Assess supply chain risk

### Phase 3: Threat Analysis (15 minutes)
1. **Identify Attack Vectors**
   - External entry points (APIs, forms, uploads)
   - Internal attack surfaces (services, databases)
   - Third-party integrations
   - Admin interfaces

2. **Assess Impact & Likelihood**
   - Data breach potential
   - System compromise risk
   - Reputation damage
   - Compliance violations

3. **Prioritize by Risk**
   - CVSS scoring when applicable
   - Critical → High → Medium → Low
   - Business impact consideration

4. **Document Exploitation Scenarios**
   - Step-by-step attack path
   - Prerequisites for exploit
   - Impact assessment
   - Detection methods

### Phase 4: Recommendations (10-15 minutes)
1. **Immediate Remediation** (Critical issues)
   - Specific code fixes with examples
   - Configuration changes
   - Dependency updates

2. **Short-term Improvements** (High/Medium)
   - Architecture enhancements
   - Additional security controls
   - Monitoring and alerting

3. **Long-term Security Posture**
   - Security training recommendations
   - Tooling improvements
   - Process enhancements
   - Compliance roadmap

### Phase 5: Verification (5 minutes)
1. Run security scanning tools
2. Verify no secrets in code
3. Check dependency vulnerabilities
4. Validate .env files not in git

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

### Security Mistakes
- ❌ **Security by Obscurity**: Hiding implementation details instead of fixing vulnerabilities
  ✅ Assume attacker has full knowledge; fix root cause

- ❌ **Client-Side Security Only**: Validating only in frontend
  ✅ Always validate on server; client validation is UX, not security

- ❌ **Hardcoded Credentials**: API keys, passwords in code
  ✅ Use environment variables or secret management services

- ❌ **Weak Password Storage**: Plaintext, MD5, SHA1
  ✅ Use bcrypt, Argon2, or scrypt with proper work factors

- ❌ **Missing Rate Limiting**: No protection against brute force
  ✅ Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints (e.g., 5 attempts/15 min)

- ❌ **Insufficient Logging**: Not logging security events
  ✅ Log all auth attempts, access control decisions, admin actions

- ❌ **Trusting User Input**: Assuming data is safe
  ✅ Validate, sanitize, and encode all user input

- ❌ **SQL String Concatenation**: Building queries with user input
  ✅ Use parameterized queries or ORMs exclusively

- ❌ **Missing Authentication**: Unprotected admin endpoints
  ✅ Require auth on ALL non-public endpoints

- ❌ **Overly Verbose Errors**: Exposing system details in errors
  ✅ Generic errors to user, detailed logs for admins
